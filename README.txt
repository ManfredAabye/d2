TODO: Converting for Dotnet 8.0


Welcome to D2!

== OVERVIEW ==

D2 is a BSD Licensed Open Source project whose purpose is to provide a
simple-to-use binary distribution of OpenSim, along with a few
addon-ons and tools that make it easy to manage and maintain your
virtual world.

This project contains the code for some of the tools, along with the
code for creating a packaged zip file out of an extended opensim
tree. It does not contain the extended opensim tree itself. That is
hosted in another project called diva-distribution.

The binary packages produced by D2 can be found at
http://metaverseink.com/Downloads.html

== More Information on OpenSim ==

More extensive information on building, running, and configuring
OpenSim, as well as how to report bugs, and participate in the OpenSim
project can always be found at http://opensimulator.org.
